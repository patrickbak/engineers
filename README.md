The following project was realised for engineer's thesis at my University. This application is a web app that allows user to create his own 
car configuration.

# How to install the application

1. Make sure you have server that provides PHP interpreter like XAMPP with Apache that I used for this project.
2. Once you have installed that environment, install database that is placed inside 'database' folder as 'car_conf.sql'
3. After that just run the server and open 'index.html' file that is a starting page for application.

NOTE: The project isn't finished because creating pdf files with configuration doesn't work, but I decided not to work on that 
further because the rest works fine after all.
